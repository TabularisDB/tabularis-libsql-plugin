//! libSQL / Turso driver plugin for Tabularis.
//!
//! The crate is split into a thin library (this file plus the modules below)
//! and two binaries: `libsql-plugin` (the real stdio JSON-RPC server) and
//! `test_plugin` (a local REPL that drives the same dispatch code). Keeping the
//! logic in a library is what lets the REPL exercise the exact same code path.
